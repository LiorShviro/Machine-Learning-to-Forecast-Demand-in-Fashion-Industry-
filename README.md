# 🎨 Fashion Demand Forecasting using Machine Learning

This project presents a machine learning–based approach to forecasting demand in the fashion industry, with a special focus on **color trends**. The model combines unsupervised and probabilistic learning with linear programming optimization to improve production decisions and reduce waste.

## 📌 Project Summary
- **Clustering color forecasts** using K-Means
- **Seasonal probability estimation** using Bayesian Networks
- **Forecast generation** using K-NN weighted averaging
- **Optimization** using a linear programming model to maximize profit

The model aims to help fashion retailers align production planning with predicted color preferences, based on historical data and forecasts from trend agencies.

## 🧠 Techniques Used
- K-Means Clustering
- Bayesian Networks
- K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)
- Linear Programming (LP)
- Data preprocessing and pattern analysis
